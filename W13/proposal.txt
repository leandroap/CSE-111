CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

The name will be "URL and Services Tester" 

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

In the real-world a system uses to consume statics contents from an URL or data from and API, and an important principle is that "Everything fails, all the time" (Werner Vogels).
With this in mind, I will write a program to validate if an URL or service is running, and responding with the expected HTTP status or content.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

In fact, I don't know how to do HTTP requests in Python, I intend to learn how to do this using the module requests (or other if necessary).

4. What Python modules will your program use?

At this moment I plan to use the following modules:
- pytest
- requests
- csv

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

Yes, I will. I don't know for sure how many functions I will do, but I want to separate like that.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

Yes, I will do.

During this week I spent my time exploring the list of possible projects listed in the milestone, including the list of websites.
After some research I narrowed it down to the two following options: "A program that retrieves data from a server", and "A program that retrieves data from a Firebase database".

Then, I spent some time reading the documentation on those websites:

This week I had created or modified more than 15 different functions. I create two different ways to execute the program, using a menu system at the terminal (main function), where the user can choice wich options they want to use. And a command line mode, where is possible run the programs passing arguments, such --help (look at the command_line_runner function).


I haven't encountered any new topics this week, and I'm comfortable with the material we've covered so far.

Parameters make a function more reusable because you can call it in different places with different arguments.
